    <p>Hi! My name is Ana Araiza. I am a Digital Strategy graduate student at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications. This is an assignment for my Web Design class.</p>

      <p>One thing you need to know about me: I am a BIG dog girl! Or just a big animal girl in general, but dogs have a special place in my heart. I adopted my first dog a year ago, her name is Addie and she is a two-year-old golden retriever.</p>
     
      <p>I used to puppy raise for a Service Dog non-profit organization called Canine Companions. Puppy raising is basically when a volunteer gets a future service dog puppy and trains all the basic skills they need to become a service dog someday. I trained four puppies for Canine Companions. Yonder became a service dog for Matt, a man with multiplesclerosis living in Orlando. Ethel decided the pet life was more her vibe and she was adopted by her co-raiser and my friend. Huddle flew all the way to Seattle to be matched with his forever person, Sara, a lady born with cerebral palsy. My fourth was Addison, now called Addie. That's how I wound up a permanent dog mom.</p>
      
      <p>Aside from dogs, I also like doing anything crafty and creative. I love channeling myself into my work in all different medias. I am not good at all medias of course, but I enjoy it all nonetheless.</p>

      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3" class="pt-4">Background</h4>

      <p>I am 25 years old at the time of this project. I was born in Texas, but I grew up in Monterrey, Mexico. My whole family is Mexican as well, so I am very in touch with my culture despite having been in the US almost half my life by now. I moved to South Florida in 2012 at the age of 13 years old. At the time, I was very upset about it as any teen would be, being ripped away from all they've known. In hindsight, it was one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I began 7th grade here, and eventually went off to college at the University of Central Florida in 2018. Moving to Orlando was also one of the best decisions I have ever made. There, I met some of my best friends, my now long-term partner, and discovered puppy raising. I owe a lot to that city and that school.</p>
      <p>I graduated UCF in December of 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in Film and a minor in Creative Writing. I always knew Film wasn't quite where my heart was at, but I couldn't truly pinpoint where it was until recently. </p>
      
      <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">Career Goals</h4>
   
      <p>At this time, my end goal is to become a UX Designer. I love channeling my creativity into interactive designs. Through my work with Canine Companions, I have interacted a lot with people with disabilities, and that has fueled my desire to make this world a more accessible space. My dream is to either work in the non-profit sector, or at the very least, help the non-profit sector during my free time. I want to build sites that are captivating and user-friendly, while being accessible to all.</p>
